Here on main level is located project for MSVC2010.
In Jpeg2000Transcoder folder is located also project for MSVC2008.
It contains 2 folders with required files (djpeg and kdu_compress), that are built in VC2008 or VC2010.
These files must be attached to released app, on the same level as JPEG2000Transcoder.exe.
In configuration.ini change directory of images and url of IIPImage to appropriate values.
When you will be editing projects, change every $(QtDir)\4.8.1 to appropriate directory for MSVC2010 project
and every C:\Qt\4.8.2 for MSVC2008. Easiest way is find and replace in Jpeg2000Transcoder.vcxproj 
for MSVC2010 and in Jpeg2000Transcoder.vcproj for MSVC2008.
Ui file ui_jpeg2000transcoder.h was autogenerated from jpeg2000transcoder.ui that was created in 
QtCreator.
For easiest possible using in Visual studio use "Qt Visual Studio addin" (renaming of QtDir MAY be unnecessary in that case).
Good luck
